# Real World Design Patterns
Explore real-world scenarios and best practices for design patterns in this comprehensive repository. Elevate your software design skills with practical examples and insightful discussions.

## How to Learn?
For each design pattern, there is folder based on `TypeScript`. If you are comming from another programming language world, don't worry. They are not complicated.

You can open directory, for instance:

```
$ cd strategy-pattern
```

There is a `README` file that you can review first.

## Structure of Readme

Here is some steps in each `README` file:

- User Case: a short description about the specific problem that we want to solve.
- Bad Practice: a typical solution that works but not in a proper way.
- Good Practice: implementing the specified design pattern to solve the problem in a proper way.

## How to Run

After opening the design pattern directory, for each one you need to do the following:

```
$ npm install
```

To run the design pattern:

```
$ npm run start
```

To run the bad practice:

```
$ npm run start:bad
```
